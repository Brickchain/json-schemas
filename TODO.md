# TODO

## contract

* Refer to part? (Also in multipart)

## multipart

Check uri handling in general.

## realm-descriptor

We have for now removed keyHistory, but handling of key rollovers on a Realm should be reviewed later.

## receipt

JWT, we should investigate this. It's bad design when sharing receipts.

Look at params.
